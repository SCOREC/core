/**
 * \page metis APF-METIS
 *
 * METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs. More information
 * is available at https://github.com/KarypisLab/METIS.
 *
 * This module implements a PUMI interface to use METIS as an apf::Splitter or
 * as an apf::Balancer. The Balancer localizes (to rank 0) necessary graph
 * information from the mesh topology and tries to minimize the amount of data
 * sent between processes.
 *
 * The interface is in apfMETIS.h
