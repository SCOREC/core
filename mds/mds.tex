\section{Mesh Data Structure}

We present an efficient array-based storage structure for mesh
topology and associated data which remains flexible enough
to handle general unstructured mesh adaptivity.
The goal of this structure is to be at least as flexible
as existing object-based representations while providing
the efficiency gains available from array-based storage.
This storage scheme and associated algorithms will be
referred to as the Mesh Data Structure, or MDS.
A prototype of the MDS structure was implemented in the C language
and compared to an topological structure implemented
using C++ objects.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:req}

This data structure is designed to fit the requirements
laid out in the work of Shephard and Beall \cite{beall1995mesh}.
It represents an attempt to condense the structures described
by that work into contiguous arrays rather than individual objects.

We begin by listing our requirements for a mesh data structure.

\begin{enumerate}
\item It must be possible to iterate through all the entities of
a given type in a mesh.
\item It must be possible to compare two entities to see if they
are the same.
\item First order adjacencies must be retrievable in $O(1)$ time.
\item It must be possible to uniquely associate arbitrary data with each entity.
\item Boundary edges and faces must be orientable.
\item Addition and removal of entities must be constant-time operations.
\end{enumerate}

Using the data structure presented here in a full one-level configuration
\cite{beall1995mesh},
all of these requirements are fulfilled.

\section{Limitations}

This structure is built upon a few critical assumptions.
First, the mesh must be composed of entities which belong to a small set
of topological types.
More specifically, the number of $d$-dimensional downward adjacencies
of an entity of type $t$ must be a constant function of $d$ and $t$
whose value is
known at compile time.
In MDS, we refer to these values as degrees, using graph theory terminology
associated with a graph representation of adjacencies.
$\deg(t,d)$ is the number of entities of dimension $d$ adjacent
to an entity of type $t$.

General polyhedral meshes are the main exception to this requirement.
Regarding polyhedral meshes, it should be possible for the MDS structure
to accept new topological types at runtime, though its performance
will degrade as the number of types grows large.
Good performance can be found using about ten types or less, but
when more than a hundred types are involved this may no longer
be the optimal structure.

The other limitation of this structure relates to memory use
during entity removal.
In this particular design, memory use does not decrease
when entities are removed.
This is a deliberate design choice discussed in Section \ref{sec:rem}.
It also takes into account the fact that most target user
applications add at least as many entities as they remove.

\section{Flexibility}

Both Shephard \cite{beall1995mesh} and Garimella
\cite{garimella2002mesh} describe multiple representations
for a topological mesh structure.
The design of MDS is such that adjacency relations between each
pair of dimensions are stored in a separate set of arrays.
The structure is flexible enough include or omit
adjacencies between each pair of dimensions
dynamically at runtime.
This allows MDS to implement all topological mesh representations.

Because MDS takes a struct-of-arrays approach as opposed to
array-of-structs, the book-keeping required for flexibility
is handled once at the mesh level.
This is great performance advantage over designs which
embed the book-keeping in entity objects, since the
the combination of adjacencies stored is the same for
all entities.

\section{Entity identifiers}
\label{sec:id}

One of the first building blocks involved in this work
is the design of an identifier which will behave the way
pointers to entity objects currently do.
Identifiers serve in part to satisfy requirement 2 from
Section \ref{sec:req}.

An identifier for an entity in a part must be different
from all identifiers of other entities in the same part.
Currently pointers are unique to their address space, so
this is equivalent.
An identifier for an entity must also remain the same
while an entity exists on that part.
Entity pointers in an object-based representation do not
change unless the entity is removed from the part, either
through removal from the mesh or migration to another part.

Since the majority of our storage will be in contiguous
arrays per topological type, the identifier is constructed
to facilitate indexing into these arrays.
An entity identifier is a pair $(t,i)$ where $t$ is a topological
type and $i$ is an index unique to entities of that topological
type.
Although it could be a structure containing two integers, we
find that it is quite convenient to encode them into a single
integer.
Let $T$ be the number of topological types, which is fixed at
compile time.
Then the equations for encoding identifiers are quite simple:
\[e = iT + t\]
\[i = \left\lfloor \frac{e}{T} \right\rfloor\]
\[t = e \mod T\]

Identifiers therefore represent on-part mesh entities uniquely
and are readily convertible to and from $(t,i)$
pairs using one or two CPU integer operations.
In C, such identifiers are typed \texttt{mds\_id} and can
be either 32-bit or 64-bit integers, depending on the maximum
allowable size of a mesh part.
32-bit integers are used by default, since there is a 2X reduction
in memory use and billion-element parts are rare but not
unheard of.

\section{Adjacency Structures}
\label{sec:adj}

One of the key contributions of this work is a method of storing
topological upward adjacencies in a contiguous array with minimal
wasted space.
This section introduces the design of these topology structures
starting with examples followed by a rigorous definition.

\subsection{Simple Meshes}
\label{sec:simple}

To get an idea of how MDS adjacencies work, consider a simple two-triangle
mesh such as the one in Figure \ref{fig:2tri}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-1.eps}
\caption{Two-triangle mesh}
\label{fig:2tri}
\end{figure}

The adjacency relations between triangles and edges in this mesh may be
represented by the bipartite graph shown in Figure \ref{fig:bipart}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-2.eps}
\caption{Adjacency graph}
\label{fig:bipart}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-3.eps}
\caption{Downward adjacency structure}
\label{fig:down}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-4.eps}
\caption{Upward adjacency structure}
\label{fig:up}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-5.eps}
\caption{Upward adjacency encoding}
\label{fig:upn}
\end{figure}

The downward adjacency array from triangles to edges
is show in Figure \ref{fig:down} and matches the mesh
in Figure \ref{fig:2tri}
(depending on orientation and order of the triangles).
The corresponding upward adjacency structure from
edges to triangles is shown in Figure \ref{fig:up}.

Given a triangle t$i$, its $j$-th downward adjacency
is located in \texttt{down}$[3i + j]$,
where 3 is just the number of edges adjacent to a triangle.
Knowing that every triangle is always adjacent to exactly
three edges allows us to encode the array in this way
without wasting any entries.

Notice that this array relates directly to the bipartite adjacency
graph; every entry in the \texttt{down} array corresponds to an adjacency
graph edge.
The degree of a graph vertex representing a triangle, $\deg(t_i)$,
is always 3, so there are $3n_t$ adjacency relations for $n_t$ triangles.

Now, we are concerned with storing the inverse relations from edges
to triangles.
We can use the fact that the total number of relations is the same ($3n_t$).
As such, they can be stored in an array laid out just like the \texttt{down}
array.
Now, we need a scheme for grouping together relations involving the same
vertex.
Although we could make them contiguous, this will make mesh modification
difficult later down the line.
Fortunately, we can store equivalent information by using singly-linked
lists for grouping.

The array \texttt{up} is equal in size to the \texttt{down}
array, and again every entry represents a triangle-edge relation.
This time, the entries are singly-linked list nodes, their content
is an encoded pointer to the next node.
The \texttt{first\_up} array has $n_e$ entries, where $n_e$ is the
number of edges, and its entries are the heads of the lists of relations
involving each edge.
That is, the list starting at entry $i$ contains all relations involving edge
$i$.

In Figure \ref{fig:up}, an arrow from entry $a$ to entry $b$ signifies
entry $a$ has a pointer to entry $b$, and an ``X" in entry $a$
means that entry $a$ contains a null pointer, and is the end of a list.
Figure \ref{fig:upn} shows the same structure in terms of integer indices
instead of arrows.
Note that we use -1 to denote a null pointer since 0 is a valid array index.

The key to converting this lists-in-arrays structure is the fact that
entry $(3i+j)$ in \texttt{up} represents the $j$-th downward
relation of triangle $i$.
That is, the offset of an entry in the array encodes the information
about the triangle at the other end of the relation.

\subsection{Mixed Meshes}
\label{sec:mixed}

The example illustrated in Section \ref{sec:simple} is representative of meshes
which are composed of a single element type.
Exceptions to this rule are called mixed meshes.
Notable examples include meshes containing structured boundary layers.
In these cases, we have to separate arrays by type.
To illustrate this complication, consider a mesh of one triangle and one
quadrilateral as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:mixed}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-6.eps}
\caption{Simple mixed mesh}
\label{fig:mixed}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-7.eps}
\caption{Mixed downward adjacency}
\label{fig:mdown}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-8.eps}
\caption{Mixed upward adjacency}
\label{fig:mup}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-9.eps}
\caption{Mixed upward adjacency encoding}
\label{fig:mupn}
\end{figure}

In this case, one element as three downward adjacent edges and the other has
four.
We group elements by topological types and use the same representation as before
for each type.
Figure \ref{fig:mdown} shows how the downward adjacency storage has split.
We can still find the downward adjacencies for a given entity
since our identifiers encode
both type $t$ and index $i$, so we can pick the sub-array based on type and use
$3i+j$ or $4i+j$ to index into the sub-array and find the $j$-th adjacent entity.

The same is done for upward adjacencies as shown in \ref{fig:mup}.
However, this introduces an ambiguity of indexing.
Is the first upward adjacent entity of an edge a triangle or quadrilateral ?
This cannot be known {\it a priori}, so it must be encoded into the array
entries.
To do this, we use the same $(t,i)$ encoding introduced in
Section \ref{sec:id},
but this time $i$ is just an index into the array,
and there may be multiple indices per entity.
Figure \ref{fig:mupn} shows the index encoding of this structure.
For example, q2 denotes the encoding $(t,2)$, where $t$ is the arbitrary
integer constant associated with the quadrilateral type.

Although not strictly necessary, downward adjacency entries also use
$(t,i)$ encoding for consistency, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mdown}.

\subsection{Final Structure}

After all these considerations are made, the final declaration of
the \texttt{down} array in the C language is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
mds_id* down[4][MDS_TYPES];
\end{verbatim}

The entity identifier for the $j$-th $d$-dimensional
downward adjacency of $(t,i)$ is stored in
\texttt{down}$[d][t][Ci+j]$, where $C$ is the number
of $d$-dimensional downward adjacencies of all entities
of type $t$.
The number 4 comes from the reasonable assumption that space has 3 or
fewer dimensions.

Likewise, the upward adjacency structures have the following
C declarations:

\begin{verbatim}
mds_id* up[4][MDS_TYPES];
mds_id* first_up[4][MDS_TYPES];
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{up}$[d][t]$ is the same size as \texttt{down}$[d][t]$
and contains linked-list nodes for upward adjacencies from dimension $d$
to entities of type $t$.
\texttt{first\_up}$[d][t]$ has one entry per entity of type $t$; that
entry is the head of a list of upward adjacencies from that entity
to entities of dimension $d$.

\subsection{Storage and Lookup}

Looking up the stored $d$-dimensional downward adjacency of an entity $(t,i)$
is fairly simple: just read $C$ entries starting at \texttt{down}$[d][t][Ci]$,
where $C$ is the number of adjacent entities, which must be known
{\it a priori}.

Looking up the stored $d$-dimensional upward adjacency of
entity $(T,i)$ requires iterating over the list nodes starting with
$(t_0,x_0)=$\texttt{first\_up}$[d][T][i]$, stopping when the constant
-1 is found instead of a valid $(t_j,x_j)$ value.
The node after $(t_j,x_j)$ is $(t_{j+1},x_{j+1})=$\texttt{up}$[D][t_j][x_j]$,
where $D$ is the dimension of type $T$.
Every time node $(t_j,x_j)$ is visited, that means entity
$(t_j,\lfloor x_j / C_j \rfloor)$ (which has dimension $d$)
is adjacent to entity $(T,i)$, where $C_j$ is the number of
entities of dimension $d_l$ adjacent to an entity of type $t_j$.

The relation of $(t_0,i_0)$ being the $j$-th downward adjacency
of entity $(t_1,i_1)$ is actually two relations: upward and downward.
The downward relation is stored by assigning
\texttt{down}$[d_0][t_1][Ci_1+j]=(t_0,i_0)$, where $d_0$ is the
dimension of type $t_0$.

The upward relation is stored by linking the node at
\texttt{up}$[d_0][t_1]][Ci_1+j]$
into the list whose head is \texttt{first\_up}$[d_1][t_0][i_0]$,
where $d_1$ is the dimension of type $t_1$.
The node is placed as the new first node in the list, which can be
done in $O(1)$ time by copying the head's value to the node
and then having the head point to the node.
Instead of pointer assignments, we assign $(t,i)$ encoded values
to entries in \texttt{first\_up} and \texttt{up} as described
in the lookup algorithm.

\section{Mesh Modification}
\label{sec:mod}

The adjacency structures in Section \ref{sec:adj} were presented in
the context storing a description of an unchanging mesh,
and are complex enough even in that case.
Here we consider how they can be used efficiently to implement
mesh modification operations.

Mesh modification is required by mesh adaptation, and we know
from experience developing the MeshAdapt library that all the
relevant mesh modification operations can be implemented as
a series of mesh entity additions and removals.
Addition and removal would appear to be the weak spots of an
array-based representation, but this section describes how
we can implement them such that performance is no worse
than an object-based structure.

\subsection{Entity Addition}

Given a mesh represented by topology structures as described in \ref{sec:adj},
we need an efficient way to add an entity to the mesh.
The first problem is that there is no room left in the arrays,
so they must increase in size.
If the size of one array is $n$, increasing it to $n+1$ requires
copying $n$ entities from the old memory to the new memory.
However, we can also increase it to size $\alpha n, \alpha > 1$
with the same amount of copying.
This leaves auxiliary space at the end of the array, which can
be used for other entity additions, meaning that those
additions happen immediately with no copying.
This well-known scheme for growing arrays amortizes the cost
of reallocation and results in an $O(1)$ average runtime
complexity.

Notice that although the memory has moved, all entities are identified
by array offsets, which have not changed, so the identifiers
still obey the desired properties.

\subsection{Entity Removal}
\label{sec:rem}

When adding entities, we had control over their resulting index
and chose to conveniently place it at the end of the active array.
Removals, however, are specified by the user and may happen at
any place within the array.
Once the entity is removed, it leaves an unused hole in the array.

One option would be to fill this hole immediately, either by
moving all subsequent entities down by one or just taking the last entity
and moving it to fill the hole.
Both of these approaches invalidate entity identifiers, which
is bad for the user interface.
In addition, the first approach makes removal too slow
and the second approach changes the order of entities.
For these reasons, we choose to let a hole remain after removal.

We track these holes with one array-based linked list per
topological type.
Entries in the array are linked list nodes, and there is
an external head pointing to the first hole.
The remaining holes are linked together.
Entries which do not represent holes store a ``live"
constant which is distinguishable from valid and
null pointer values.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-10.eps}
\caption{Free list after two removals}
\label{fig:free1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mds-11.eps}
\caption{Free list after an addition}
\label{fig:free2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:free1} shows a free list for a topological
type which began with 4 entities and had indices 2 and
0 removed, leaving two holes.

The purpose of tracking these holes is to allow subsequent
entity additions to fill them.
When the user requests an addition, this free list is first
checked.
If there are holes in the free list, the first one is unlinked
and its index is used for the new entity.
Figure \ref{fig:free2} illustrates the free list after an
entity addition filled the hole at index 0.
This algorithm ensures that all holes are filled before entities are added
at the end of the array.

\subsection{Range Markers}

The ability to handle additions efficiently requires allocating
some extra space at the end of arrays for future additions
to make use of. 
This separates the array into two parts: the part that is actually
used and the unused part at the end.
Entity removal, in turn, allows holes to be made in the used part
of the array, which means the number of ``live" entries is not
the same as the number of ``used" entries.

To keep track of all this, three integers are maintained for
each topological type.
The \texttt{n} counter keeps track of the actual number of entities
of that topological type currently in the mesh part.
This should be equal to the number of used entries minus the number
of holes.
The position of the first unused entry in the array is kept in
\texttt{end}, which is also the number of used entries.
Finally, the actual allocated size is stored in \texttt{cap}.

\section{Results}

The following table lists mesh memory usage (reported as ``in use bytes"
by the C/C++ memory allocator) for different mesh libraries
when loading a serial all-tet mesh of 93710 elements.
The mesh has matched entities along the surface.
All of these libraries are storing the same information:
a full one-level adjacency representation, coordinates,
classification, matches, etc.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
library & MB & bytes per tet & relative \\\hline
pumi & 84.1 & 897 & 100\% \\
sim  & 55.2 & 589 &  66\% \\
mds  & 22.6 & 241 &  27\% \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If we remove from MDS all the non-topological data such as coordinates,
classification, etc., we are left with the core MDS structure described
above, which uses 12.5 MB of data for this mesh, or roughly half
the total data.

In addition, we can predict the memory use of an application using
a reduced representation based on MDS by removing all interior
faces and edges, then storing only the one-level adjacencies
between elements and vertices, faces and edges, and edges and vertices.
That structure took up 7.4 MB for this mesh.
This works out to about 79 bytes per element for a reduced representation
in MDS.

By comparison, Dyedov et al published a half-facet mesh data structure
called AHF,
implemented both within the MOAB library and as standalone C code
generated from MATLAB code \cite{dyedov2014ahf}.
This structured stored just the topological data, and memory use
was measured for both implementations on various meshes.
For their largest mesh, which had similar proportions of boundary
faces to our test mesh, the MOAB\_AHF implementation used 80 bytes
per element while the standalone integer-based AHF C code used about
39 bytes per element.
