/** \page mds MDS
  The compact Mesh Data Structure is a full-featured parallel unstructured
  mesh representation that is stored mainly in large arrays,
  thus improving locality and reducing memory use.
  It aims to be the default SCOREC mesh data structure.

  A technical description of the storage scheme can be found here:
  http://scorec.rpi.edu/~dibanez/mds.pdf

  Following the design philosophy of APF, we don't even publish the
  internal API for the MDS structure (though it is here and quite clean),
  instead users interact with an MDS mesh through an apf::Mesh2 interface.

  The public API is in apfMDS.h
