\section{Overview}
An SPR-based error estimation procedure is defined in detail
in Section 2.2.2 of Jie Wan's RPI thesis.
We have reimplemented this system using the latest APF
libraries and it supports the Albany adaptive cycle.
This document details the inner workings of this estimator.

From a high level, the SPR-based error estimator works by
recovering a $p$-order field from what is essentially
a $(p-1)$-order input field, then it computes the
error at each element as a function of the difference
between the input (less accurate) and output
(hopefully more accurate) fields. 

The input to SPR is actually a ``field" $\epsilon$ that contains values
at integration points rather than nodes.
This is typically the result of some kind of gradient computation
$\epsilon = \nabla f$ from a $p$-order field $f$.
In mechanics applications, $\epsilon$ is a strain or stress quantity
evaluated at integration points.
Note that the choice of integration points is independent of
anything else, although typically they should be chosen such
that they can integrate a field of order $p$.

\section{Field Recovery}
The SPR recovery process generates a $p$-order field $\epsilon^*$ which
has values at the nodes for the same quantity that the
input $\epsilon$ provides at integration points.

This recovery is done node-by-node, and the value at each
node is recovered by fitting an ordinary $p$-order polynomial
$q (x, y, z) = v$ using input data $v_i = \epsilon(x_i, y_i, z_i)$
at integration points $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ around the node.
The collection of integration points is done by building
a ``patch" of mesh elements around the node.

Fitting a polynomial from data is done by solving a least-squares linear
system $Ac \approx b$.
The solution $c$ should minimize $\|Ac - b\|$, and represents
the coefficients of the polynomial $q$.
For example, if $p=1$:
\[q(x,y,z) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 y + c_3 z \]

Each data point becomes a row of the linear system:

\[q(x_i,y_i,z_i) = c_0 + c_1 x_i + c_2 y_i + c_3 z_i \approx v_i \]

Which can be expressed as a dot product:

\[q(x_i,y_i,z_i) = (1,x_i,y_i,z_i)(c_0,c_1,c_2,c_3)^T \approx v_i \]

Which yields the matrix equation:

\[\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_0 & y_0 & z_0 \\
1 & x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
1 & x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\
\text{...}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3 \end{bmatrix}
\approx
\begin{bmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \\ v_2 \\ ... \end{bmatrix}
\]

The matrix $A$ on the left is then $m\times n$ where $m$
is the number of sample points and $n$ is the number of
polynomial coefficients.
We would rather have an over-determined answer than
an under-determined one, so we require $m \geq n$.
Typically, we get $m > n$, in which case the solution
is not exact and we must choose coefficients to minimize

\[ \left( \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (q(x_i,y_i,z_i) - v_i)^2 \right)^\frac12 \]

To solve the least squares problem $Ac \approx v$, we
use a QR factorization approach.
We use Householder reflectors to obtain a decomposition

\[QR = A, QQ^T = I, QRc \approx v, Rc = Q^Tv\]

Where R is upper triangular and Q is stored implicitly
as a set of Householder vectors.
This allows us to compute $y = Q^Tv$ implicitly
(which is more accurate)
and then solve $Rc = y$, which is an $n\times n$ problem,
with back substitution.

However, the solution $c$ can only be accurately found
if the matrix $A$ is well-conditioned, i.e. rank$(A) = n$.
We must be concerned with this because least-squares polynomial
fitting is well-known for producing ill-conditioned matrices.
The QR solver provides a single point of inspection where
a division by zero will occur if $A$ is ill-conditioned,
so it will signal a failure in this case.

During recovery, the sample points consist of all
integration points in the elements of the patch.
Therefore, we must increase the number of elements
in the patch so long as the resulting $A$ does
not satisfy the conditions $m \geq n$ and rank$(A) = n$.

The elements $S$ in the patch are collected as follows
until those conditions are met:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Patch building algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State let $o$ be the mesh entity to which the node is associated.
\State set $S$ to be the elements adjacent to $o$ $(S \gets o\{M^3\})$.
\Loop
\For{$d$ from 2 down to 0}
\State add the elements adjacent by $d$-dimension entities to $S$
$(S \gets S\{M^d\}\{M^3\})$.
\If{$S$ has enough elements}
\State \Return $S$
\EndIf
\EndFor
\EndLoop
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Finally, once the patch is obtained, the integration points
$(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ and the field values $\epsilon(x_i,y_i,z_i) = v_i$
from the input are used to build $A$ and $v$.
Note that the field values $v_i$ may be tensors instead of scalars,
in which case the analysis is solved one component at a time.
Each component $j$ forms a set of scalar values $v^{(j)} = (v_0^{(j)},...,v_m^{(j)})^T$
and results in a set of polynomial coefficients $c^{(j)}$
that minimize $\|Ac^{(j)} - v^{(j)}\|$ and define a polynomial $q^{(j)}(x,y,z)$.
We then evaluate this polynomial at the location $(x_a,y_a,z_a)$
of the node to obtain the field component value at
that node: $\epsilon^*(x_a,y_a,z_a)^{(j)} = \rho^{(j)}(x_a,y_a,z_a)$.
One can also think of the coefficients $c$ being
tensors.
Note that the matrix $A$ remains the same for each component,
only the right hand side $v^{(j)}$ changes to give a different
$c^{(j)}$. This allows us to only compute the QR decomposition
of A once and only repeat the computations of $y=Q^Tv^{(j)}$
and $Rc^{(j)}=y$.

\section{Error Estimation}

A per-element scalar error estimate
$\|e_\epsilon\|_e$ is computed using the
norm of the integrated difference between
direct and recovered gradient fields.
\[e_\epsilon=\epsilon - \epsilon^*\]
The current implementation uses entry-wise L2 norms on
3x3 matrices, which seems to agree with Wan's thesis.
The following notations describe the L2 norm integration
over an element and over the whole mesh:

\[\|A\|_e=
\left(
\int_{\Omega^e} A : A d\Omega
\right)^\frac12,
\|A\|=
\left(
\sum_{e=1}^{n_e}
\int_{\Omega^e} A : A d\Omega
\right)^\frac12\]

Where $A:A$ is the Frobenius inner product.
If $\|A\|$ or $\|A\|_e$ will be computed for
some matrix field $A$, it may be advantageous
to store the field $A:A$.

\section{Size Field Computation}

A per-element scalar size factor is computed based on
the per-element error following this formula:

\[h^\text{new}_e = h^\text{current}_e
\|e_\epsilon\|^{-\frac{2}{2p+d}}_e
\left(
\frac
{\hat{\eta}^2\|\epsilon^*\|^2}
{\sum_{i=1}^n\|e_\epsilon\|^\frac{2d}{2p+d}_i}
\right)^\frac{1}{2p}
\]

To which the following definitions apply:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$d$ & element dimension \\
$p$ & polynomial order of $f$ \\
$\eta$ & $\frac{\|e_\epsilon\|}{\|\epsilon\|}$ \\
$\hat{\eta}$ & threshold on $\eta$ for adaptivity \\
$n$ & number of elements in the mesh \\
$h_e^\text{current}$ & the current element size (longest edge) \\
$h_e^\text{new}$ & the desired element size for adaptivity \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Finally, a linear isotropic size field at
the vertices is recovered from the per-element
size factors $h_e^\text{new}$ by a simple
process of averaging the values from elements
adjacent to a vertex.

\section{Target Size Field Computation}

In practical applications, it is desirable to target a specified
number of elements $N$ during mesh adaption to avoid over-coarsening
or over-refinement, and to avoid exhausting the memory on the available
machine.

Boussetta et al. (``Adaptive remeshing based on a posteriori error
estimation for forging simulation'') define a size field specification
by the following:
\[
h^{new}_e = \left(
\frac{\theta_{uni}}{\theta_e} \right)
^{( \frac{2}{2p +d} )} h_e
\]
where $\theta_e$ is the element-wise contribution to the error,
$\theta_{uni}$ is the value of a uniformly distributed error
across the mesh, $h_e^{new}$ is the new element mesh size,
$h_e$ is the old element mesh size, $p$ is the polynomial order
of accuracy of the finite element method, and $d$ is the number
of spatial dimensions of the mesh.

Let $G$ be a globally computed error metric given by:
\[
G = \sum_e^n \left( \theta_e \right) ^{(\frac{2d}{2p+d})}
\]
where $n$ is the total number of elements in the mesh.
Then value of the uniformly distributed error is given by
\[
\theta_{uni} = \left( \theta_{imp} \right) ^{( \frac{2p+d}{2p} )}
\left( G \right) ^{-(\frac{2p+d}{4p} )}
\]
where $\theta_{imp}$ is a prescribed accuracy parameter. 
To generate a size field that will yield an adapted
mesh with approximately $N$ elements, the accuracy parameter
$\theta_{imp}$ is given by
\[
\theta_{imp} = \left( N \right) ^{-(\frac{p}{d})}
\left( G \right)^{(\frac{2p+d}{2d})}
\]

Algebraic manipulation of these quantities yields a simpler
equivalent expression for the new element size field:
\[
h_e^{new} = \left(\frac{G}{N}\right)^{\frac{1}{d}}
\left( \theta_e \right)^{-(\frac{2}{2p+d})} h_e
\]
The element-level error contribution $\theta_e$ is chosen to be
\[
\theta_e = \left( 
\int_{\Omega^e}(\epsilon - \epsilon^*) : (\epsilon - \epsilon^*)
\text{d} \Omega
\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
as is done in the previous size field computation.

In addition to targeting a specified number of elements in the
output mesh, Boussetta et al. define user-input parameters
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ to control the gradients of the mesh size
field such that
\[
\alpha < \frac{h_e^{new}}{h_e} < \beta
\]
