 * \brief Concrete Capstone GMI implementation.
 *
 * This interface can be used in two ways:
 *
 * 1. to import an existing Capstone model; and
 * 2. to load the model and (optionally) meshes from a CRE file by wrapping
 *    Capstone calls.
 *
 * The first option results in a non-owned model (gmi_cap_start does not need
 * to be called). The second option results in an owned model (gmi_cap_start
 * MUST be called) for which destruction is handled by gmi_destroy. Both
 * options require gmi_register_cap to be called. It is recommended to call
 * gmi_cap_start (if desired) before gmi_register_cap.
