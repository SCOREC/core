/** \page zoltan APF-Zoltan

  Zoltan is a unification of several scientific data partitioning tools
  which are especially suited to parallel mesh partitioning.
  It is developed at Sandia National Labs, and its home page is
  http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan/

  This package implements an interface between APF and Zoltan,
  Converting data from an apf::Mesh to Zoltan data structures,
  running one of the many algorithms available in Zoltan, and
  using the result to migrate the mesh.
  By using a mesh abstraction together with a partitioner abstraction,
  we create a very general and useful component.

  The interface is in apfZoltan.h
