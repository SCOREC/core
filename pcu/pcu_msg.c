/* the pcu_msg algorithm for a communication phase
   is as follows:

1  barrier
2  pack data to be sent
3  requests = send all packed data
4  while (requests not done)
5    receive and process data
6  begin barrier
7  while (barrier not done)
8    receive and process data

   The main goal of this is to detect when no more
   messages will be received.

   To prove that this works, note the following:
   1. messages are sent using a synchronous
      non-blocking send: requests are not done
      until the message is received at its destination.
   2. the barrier is not done on any rank until
      after all ranks have begun the barrier
   3. all requests of this rank are done before this
      rank begins the barrier
   From this we can prove:
   1. if all requests of this rank are done, all messages sent by
      this rank have been received at their destinations
   2. when the barrier is done, all messages sent by all ranks
      have been received at their destinations, i.e.
      no more messages can be received.

   Finally, the barrier at line 1 is there because it takes
   different amounts of time for each rank to be notified
   that the barrier is done, and in that time the rank is
   naively processing everything it receives.
   If another rank is notified first and quickly goes on to
   a new phase, it may be able to send a message that is
   received by the slow rank out-of-phase.
