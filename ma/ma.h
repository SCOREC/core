/** \page ma MeshAdapt
   This is the main API for SCOREC's MeshAdapt software, version 2

   These functions run parallel mesh adaptation based on various
   types of size fields, with optional user-defined solution transfer.

   If no solution transfer is specified, MeshAdapt will automatically
   transfer all nodal fields and some integration point fields.

   Features such a snapping and matched entity support are activated
   automatically if the input structures support them.

   An interface is also provided where users can pick and choose
   what MeshAdapt does and adjust some parameters.

 - The main API is in ma.h
 - Most users may need to also tweak settings using maInput.h
 - For defining size functions, see maSize.h
 - In you need special solution transfer, see maSolutionTransfer.h
